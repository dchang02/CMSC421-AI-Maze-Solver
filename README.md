# AI Maze Solver (Uniformed and Informed Search): 
## This program generates and solves mazes using uninformed and informed search strategies. This project demonstrates the basics of search algorithms.
- The project will randomly generate a 2-dimensional (n x n) sized maze.
- The maze consists of (n x n) maze cells with the top-left cell being the starting cell and the bottom-right cell being the ending cell.
- The maze contains randomly generated walls in the maze cells.
- Using a variety of uninformed and informed search strategies, the program will proceed to solve the maze.
- There will be settings to control the size of the maze and what algorithm is being used to solve the maze.
- The program will have a visual display of which maze cells have not been visited yet and which cells have been visited.
- After the maze is solved, the program will display the optimal path from the starting cell to the ending cell.
